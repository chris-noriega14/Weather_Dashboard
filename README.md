Description of webpage:

This webpage is a weather dashboard that displays today's common weather data for a city as well as a 5-day forecast for that same city.

The user can input the city in two ways: By typing in the city in a form and submitting the information, or by clicking on one of the buttons that show featured cities.

Once the user clicks/submits the information, the weather dashboard webpage populates the data for the following elements:

•	City Name
•	Today's Date
•	Temperature
•	Wind Speed
•	Humidity
•	UV Index

Additionally, the 5-day forecast is populated with the following elements:

•	Future Date
•	Weather Icon
•	Temperature
•	Wind Speed
•	Humidity

In order to achieve this, the webpage has to fetch the open weather app API and retrieve the following elements: Temperature: data.main.temp, Wind Speed: data.wind.speed, Humidity:data.main.humidity, Weather icon:
data.weather[0].icon.
